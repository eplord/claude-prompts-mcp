# Client knowledge (adapters, output dirs, capabilities) is built into the CLI.
# This file controls WHAT to export. The CLI handles HOW.

# Opt-in resource allow-list. Only listed resources are exported.
# Format: {resourceType}:{category}/{id} for prompts, {resourceType}:{id} for others.
# Set to 'all' to export everything.
exports:
  - prompt:development/validate_work

# Optional: override default output directories per client.
# Omit entirely to use conventions (~/.{client}/skills/, etc.)
